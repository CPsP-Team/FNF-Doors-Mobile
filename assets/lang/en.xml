    <bobsBook>
        <intro value="Hi, I’m Bob, I’m not going to spend my time writing about me and how I ended up here because that is not important right now, although I may add it once I’ve finished writing this book.
I’m writing this about something else. About this “Hotel”, if you can even call it that. 
I’m at least going to document everything I discover about this place. Maybe it can help someone else, or make me a lot of money once I sell this book! 
I hope this helps. Turn back while you still can."/>

        <hotel value="There's something off about this hotel. I'll detail things I find here and in the following pages.
Update - Door 3: There's 2 doors at every crossing, all rooms look like weird hallways. I hear some weird sounds but there's no one there, I think I'm alone. I hope at least.
Update - Door 9: I'm not alone.
Update - Door 27: There are eyes in the walls, in the paintings even. I don't wanna continue anymore.
Update - Door 49: The next room looks like a library. I can hear something roaring behind that damned door."/>

        <entities value="Those &quot;Entities&quot;...
They aren’t like anything I’ve ever seen, not animals nor humans. I don’t even know if they are real or inside my head. 
I’ll continue documenting my discoveries in this book. I’ll let you know, reader, what I encounter in future.."/>

        <guidingLight value="A seemingly helpful entity. It can talk and accompanies me when I'm lost trying to find my way.
It seems to have a better understanding of the environment I'm in."/>

        <hide value="This entity is a weird thing I noticed in the closets. I don't think it's a malignent conscious entity, but it's definitely weird.
I decided to hide in one of the closets while I wrote this book, but my eyes started to hurt, and I got a strong headache, until I left the closet. 
Update: I found a crucifix in a drawer and decided to open a closet, it instantly slammed shut. Don't know what that was all about."/>

        <rush value="Holy fuck, that one is a conscious and malignent thing.
It looks like a big flying head with dark smoke emitting from it. It seems to always smile, as far as I can tell at least.
It’s hard to describe this one’s appearance because of how fast it moves, I tried to draw it the best I could.
It can charge through doors. So hiding behind one won’t do you any good. I just think it patrols all the rooms though, it doesn’t look everywhere for prey.
Definitely hostile, using the closets to hide has worked in ensuring my survival."/>

        <screech value="A smaller entity than the others. It seems to have tentacles or spikes of some sort.
I've only encountered it in dark rooms, and always hints it's arrival with a &quot;Psst&quot; sound before attacking. It will always attack you in your blind spot, and then bite.
I noticed him when I heard it's &quot;Psst&quot; and then felt a sharp pain on my left leg, glad I found some bandages beforehand."/>

        <ambush value="Very similar to Rush. It’s also a big flying head, although it emits a bright green glow instead of dark smoke.
I would’ve said that Ambush is easier to avoid as its green glow gives you a lot more time to react, but I was quick to notice that instead of dashing forward once, it rebounds back and fourth.
It’s constantly screeching when nearby so once it stops, you can tell that it’s safe to get out of your hiding spot."/>

        <timothy value="I don’t think it can hurt as much as the other entities, he’s just a regular spider. I think I'll name it Timothy, I've seen it multiple times so I might as well dedicate a page to him.
I always get scared when it jumps from the drawers onto my face. It sometimes bites, but I've always had a thing for spiders."/>

        <seek value="I'm writing this after the biggest sprint of my life. I turned back and saw this entity chasing me.
This one is definitely conscious, and intelligent. It can manipulate the hotel itself in some way, making chandeliers fall from the ceiling for instance.
If you see it, run away until you don't hear it's loud footsteps. Don't let it catch you under any circumstance, I don't think it'd end well for you."/>

        <eyes value="This entity was really hard to draw, as I couldn’t directly stare at it. Eyes is a large purple light with a lot of eyes in the centre of it, 20~ish eyes maybe?
Looking at it makes me feel like all my organs are shutting down, along with a massive headache. The best thing you can do would be closing your eyes, or looking in the opposite direction. 
But as I always say, &quot;Heart, Liver, Lungs&quot; focus on yourself and you should be able to resist it for a few more seconds."/>

        <figure value="It's in the library."/>
